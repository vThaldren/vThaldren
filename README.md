## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm vThaldren, and this is my account of my developed and in-progress work.\
I currently do work on Total Annihilation (1997) to help bring the game up to modern systems support.\
I am also working on adding new features to the game to enable the modders and players to do some really cool things.

If you are looking to help with any of my projects, make a pull request to the respective repository(ies).\
If you have found bugs within my projects or have a suggestion, please make an issue for the respective project repository.\
Be sure to check out my vThaldren-Developments organization where all of my projects reside!
